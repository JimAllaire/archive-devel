<dc:description>Remembers the joy that brought about her faith and is full of gratitude for the Mass. Reveling in the hustle and bustle at Tamar's house in Vermont, she recalls "God's goodness and the sacramentality of things." On a speaking trip through Pennsylvania she mentions several strikes and the problems of unemployed miners.</dc:description>
