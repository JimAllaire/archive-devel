<dc:description>Discusses the partial censorship of St. Therese's autobiography by her Carmelite sisters, because of her intimate and sexual language when discussing her love relationship with Jesus. Also discusses Therese's suffering with Jesus as a love in practice which is a "harsh and dreadful thing."</dc:description>
