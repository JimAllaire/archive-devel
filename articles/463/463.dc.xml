<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Eulogizes Gandhi as a pacifist martyr and a clear example of "divinized humanity." Sees his death as added to the sacrifice of Christ, sharing in the folly of the cross. Calls his way of non-violence "the full way, because he adhered to an Absolute."</dc:description>
