<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An impassioned appeal to American workers asking them not to participate in the production of goods which will be used to wage war. She reminds workers of their power and begs them to unite and again sacrifice to further international truth and justice, not mass killing and destruction.</dc:description>
