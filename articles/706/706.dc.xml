<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Responds to a newspaper article about herself and the Catholic Worker movement. Disagrees with elements of the articles, in particular the description of those who are served and the workers as "derelicts." Urges an understanding of the poor that embraces Christ's message. Discusses Orwell's and Tolstoi's views of the poor. Describes the rich life of those who participate in the Catholic Worker movement and contrasts elements of the Worker program to that found in city missions.</dc:description>
