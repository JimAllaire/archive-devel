<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Discusses the differences and similarities of the Worker Priests and the Little Brothers. Explains the Church's condemnation of some worker-priests who advocated a close a association between Marxism and Catholicism, but is distraught at the Church's inconsistency in not condemning those priests who are closely linked to capitalism. Sees the present day scandal of the Church as an imbalance between spiritual and material works.</dc:description>
