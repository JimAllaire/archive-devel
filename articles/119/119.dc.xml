<dc:description>Assures the continuation of religious practices in Cuba, and argues from "Pacem in Terris" that Catholics and Communists can reform the social order together. Depicts her past association with Communists as positive and argues, quoting Rahner, that no person or system is a total embodiment of evil.</dc:description>
