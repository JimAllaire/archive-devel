Pope John XXIII
===============

**By Dorothy Day**

American Dialogue, 1 (July-August 1964):8-10.

*Summary: Assures the continuation of religious practices in Cuba, and
argues from "Pacem in Terris" that Catholics and Communists can reform
the social order together. Depicts her past association with Communists
as positive and argues, quoting Rahner, that no person or system is a
total embodiment of evil. (DDLW \#119).*
