<dc:description>On a hot and humid August day she describes their neighborhood and the many visitors coming and going. Longs for the country and the beach. Mentions several Workers who participated in freedom rides in the South as part of the civil rights movement. Mentions several conferences on third-world development noting that "some kind of ownership which gives security" is needed in the U.S. as well as elsewhere.</dc:description>
