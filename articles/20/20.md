Commonweal, 53 (December 29, 1950):300-301.

*Summary: A reply to an editorial on Korea's situation. Describes the
country's landowner, Japan, as the dominant source to Korea's
injustices. Criticizes Commonweals detachment from the peoples
suffering, and calls her readers to put away the American way of life
and take on Christ's way, which will call a stop to Korea's slaughter.
