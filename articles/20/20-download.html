<P><I>Summary: 
 A reply to an editorial on Korea's situation. Describes the country's landowner, Japan, as the dominant source to Korea's injustices. Criticizes Commonweals detachment from the peoples suffering, and calls her readers to put away the American way of life and take on Christ's way, which will call a stop to Korea's slaughter.
