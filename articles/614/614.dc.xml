<dc:description>Notes they have differences of opinion about pacifism and the use of force. Observes that Gandhi said "anger is violence." Speaks fondly of their Mott Street neighbors just before their move to new quarters. Struggles with the decision to acquire a farm on Staten Island and shares a meditation on "the everlasting arms which sustain us" while riding the ferry back to the city.</dc:description>
