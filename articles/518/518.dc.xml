<dc:description>Saddened by cuts to care at a nearby mental hospital, she calls for more conscientious objectors to do alternative service. Appreciates the work for the poor of Jean Vanier, Mother Theresa of Calcutta, and the Russian Orthodox saint, Alexander Nevsky. Reminisces about visits to Mississippi and the life and work of Medgar and Charles Evers for racial equality.</dc:description>
