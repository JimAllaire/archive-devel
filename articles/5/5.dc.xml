<dc:description>States the objectives of the C.W. and defends it against the
accusations of other Catholics and secular thought. Writes on
such themes as marriage, sex, 10VQ' human condition, poverty,
economics and a variety of Church doctrines. All of these topics
are treated from an orthodox Catholic point of view. The book
is adapted from the diary she kept in 1948, when she spent the
first four months with Tamar (daughter) and the rest of the year
at Mott street and the retreat farm in Newburgh. She noted that
the book could be called a woman's book, since parts of it are
directed solely to women. As usual, much of the book dwells on
the day to day happenings in her life.</dc:description>
