A story of a stranger whose presence she admires from a distance. Although they never met, she senses some sort of mystical affinity toward her. Seeing her at Mass every morning and Benediction at night, Dorothy shares an unexpreesed friendship with the working woman. At the end of the article she reveals her belief that the woman is Mary, the Blessed Mother. (DDLW #84). </I>
