<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Discusses the difficulty of women opposing the war when they are not directly involved in it. Argues her pacifist position, that if every group resorted to violence when attacked, society would be in a state of chaos. Christian techniques should be developed to resist war. Describes the loneliness of being a C.O. during wartime, and encourages women to assist in the peace movement.</dc:description>
