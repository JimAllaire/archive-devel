<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Describes the beginning of the first women's House of Hospitality and how this work of mercy spread to other cities. Explains how P. Maurin gave birth to this idea and why there is need not only to promote the faith through pamphlets and newspapers but also to institute works of mercy. The Houses are described much like how a family is run.</dc:description>
