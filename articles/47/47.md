The Catholic Worker
===================

**By Dorothy Day**

The Rosary, (November 1933):11,30.

*Summary: A genesis account of the C.W., highlighting how Dorothy's
faith and prayer has led her to where she is. Makes the distinction
between liberalism and radicalism and defends her past socialism as a
sincere but misguided attempt to alleviate social injustice. (DDLW
