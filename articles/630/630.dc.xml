<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A difficult eulogy for Maurice O'Connell who lived at the Easton farm for over 10 years. Notes his helpful side as a worker and his cantankerous nature that tried the patience of nearly everyone in the community. Reflects on the interplay of supernatural love and human freedom.</dc:description>
