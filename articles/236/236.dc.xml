<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A new year's reflection on the ways they have failed Peter Maurin's vision. Concludes "About all the above failures, I must say that I am not much concerned. I think that such failures are inseparable to a work of this kind, and necessary for our growth in holiness." Stresses trying to put ideas into action, more clarification of thought, continuing this "tiny work."</dc:description>
