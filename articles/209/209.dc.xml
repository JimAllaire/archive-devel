<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Recounts her involvement with the I. W. W. in Chicago and, in some detail, an accidental jail experience. After a move to New Orleans she starts to make "visits" to Church. With the money from selling a book she wrote, she buys a beach house, enters into a common law marriage, and begins to "read and think and ponder, and I notice from my notebooks that it was at this time that I began to pray more earnestly."</dc:description>
