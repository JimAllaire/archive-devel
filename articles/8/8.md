*Summary: A biography of St. Therese of Lisieux, whose life exemplifies
that of "the little way". She is described as one who knew the problems
of daily living and saw that sanctity was not limited to great miracles
and martyrdom but lay also in living God's Word in the routine affairs
of daily life. Places Therese largely in the context of her family and
discusses the interaction and effects her family had on her. A smaller
portion is given to her life in the convent. The author also discusses
the working class struggle in France and how Therese's family reacted to
it. Dorothy appeared to have some misgivings about the book when she
wrote, "I am a diarist, a journalist not a biographer. (DDLW \#8).*
