<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>


The Life of the Spirit, 8 (December 1953):242-252.

</p>

<P><I>Summary: 
 Approaches pacifism in the context of the spiritual. i.e. the gospel. Only through spiritual weapons can peace be attained, and not through a propaganda of hate which reduces the enemy to something less than human. Comments on the opposition of the Church to the C.W.'s view of pacifism, but is encouraged by the hierarchy's approval of the C.W. movement on the whole. (DDLW #94). </I></p>
