<h1 id="eviction">Eviction</h1>
<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>Jubilee, 6 (November 1958):28-35.</p>
<p><em>Summary: Describes the eviction from Chrystie Street, since the area is being demolished. Sees this as a trend across the country. Tells of C.W.'s being evicted either because they do not Beet building regulations or other project&quot; are being built in their place. Explains the need to eliminate slums, but destroying them first and giving the poor no other place to go is not the answer. (DDLW #108).</em></p>
