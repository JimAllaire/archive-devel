<dc:description>Describes the eviction from Chrystie Street, since the area is being demolished. Sees this as a trend across the country. Tells of C.W.'s being evicted either because they do not Beet building regulations or other project" are being built in their place. Explains the need to eliminate slums, but destroying them first and giving the poor no other place to go is not the answer.</dc:description>
