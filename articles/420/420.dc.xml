<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Quotes from Cardinal Newman's Lenten sermons on the Crossand austerity. Comments on the sacrifices daily living requires, notes visitors: a priest and a former lieutenant, and upholds discussion as a necessity for indoctrination and clarification of thought. Contrasts the death of a Catholic worker with the birth of a baby to the wife of a political prisoner in jail for refusing conscription. Tells of the closing of the Boston House of Hospitality and ends by commending the volunteers who sell the newspaper.</dc:description>
