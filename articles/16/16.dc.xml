<dc:description>Distinguishes between individuals in society and persons in society. The former are isolated monads who are "weak and adrift", the latter are a part of a body, (the Body of Christ) which draw strength from each other. The liturgy teaches this unity, which is indispensable for social regeneration.</dc:description>
