<P><I>Summary: Discourses on the correlation of material and spiritual and argues
that all is graced, i.e. all is made for God and thus everything
should be directed toward God. Even the smallest things such as
washing dishes, Sweeping floors, etc., should be placed in the
context of God's graces. Condemns mediocrity among Catholics and
speaks of the radical commitment that Christ calls from us. &quot;Our
aim is the realm of grace and not nature.&quot; Encourages the
abandonment of all worldly goods in order to attain the spiritual
ones. The book was intended as a long letter to a friend and was
largely made up of notes from retreats she attended in 1943-44.
A large portion of the book derives its material from scripture,
dwelling on the tension between flesh and spirit. Was originally
called &quot;Spiritual Adventure&quot; and comments on other topics
such as the Mass, poverty, sacrifice, prayer, sin and baptism. (DDLW #9). </I>
