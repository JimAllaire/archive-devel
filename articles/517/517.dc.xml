<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Aims to write about "the earthly spirituality that Christians need to recover." She sees it exemplified during a stay with Cesar Chavez at the farmworkers education center in La Paz, California. Speaks of the dangers he faces and his zeal, fasting, and recognition of voluntary poverty as spiritual weapons. Notes that "much is wild, prophetic and holy about our [CW] work--it is that which attracts the young who come to help us. But the heart hungers for that new social order wherein justice dwelleth."</dc:description>
