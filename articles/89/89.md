A Catholic Speaks His Mind
==========================

**By Dorothy Day**

Commonweal, 55 (April 4, 1952):690-691.

*Summary: A review of Thomas Sugrue's book A Catholic Speaks His Mind.
Praises the book's ecumenical efforts with Protestants and its criticism
of Catholics. Finds the book's weak point in its ignorance of ecumenical
movements , and its strong spot in defending the Catholic faith yet
seeking unity with other non-Catholics. (DDLW \#89).*
