<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A review of Thomas Sugrue's book A Catholic Speaks His Mind. Praises the book's ecumenical efforts with Protestants and its criticism of Catholics. Finds the book's weak point in its ignorance of ecumenical movements , and its strong spot in defending the Catholic faith yet seeking unity with other non-Catholics.</dc:description>
