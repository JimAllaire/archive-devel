<dc:description>Reports on the ongoing work on the garden commune, and how it provides a green sanctuary from the city offices. Transcribes two conversations with the working poor, one from a biscuit factory worker who had been on strike and one from a restaurant worker. Describes her daughter's confirmation and the lovely gift of a hand-printed catechism.</dc:description>
