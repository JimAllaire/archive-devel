<dc:description>Vivid description of the pulsing sounds of worship and smells of death in a black neighborhood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Admires the works of mercy at Mary Frecon's house of hospitality, and example of "the little way." Recalls the wonderful time children had at their labor day retreat and laments their expenses on the farm and for the breadline in the city.</dc:description>
