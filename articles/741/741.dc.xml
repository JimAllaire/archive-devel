<dc:description>Delights in the refreshing mornings for study and prayer at their beach houses on Staten Island, in spite of noisy children in the evening. Observes that many priests disapprove of Ammon Henacy's long fasts for peace. Suggests that the modest an prudent keep their work going more than the extremists they often attract.</dc:description>
