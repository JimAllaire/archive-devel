<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Attends a conference on establishing Christian communities, especially of families on the land. Admits that Catholic Worker attempts have not been successful because the "vision of community is not yet clear" and the spiritual foundation has not been laid. Recommends Edmond Wilson's book <I>To The Finland Station</I> on communities. </dc:description>
