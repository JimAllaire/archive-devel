<dc:description>Meditation on hospitality, that is, seeing Christ in those around us, ministering to others the way Christ ministered and was ministered to; with examples of this from the Scriptures. Encourages all to some form of the "privilege" of hospitality not because people remind us of Christ "but because they are Christ."</dc:description>
