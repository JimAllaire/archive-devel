The House on Mott Street
========================

**By Dorothy Day**

Commonweal, 28 (May 6, 1938):37-38. (Reprinted in Commonweal November
16, 1973)

*Summary: Condemns those Catholics who need to "keep up with the
Joneses." Encourages her readers not to wait for the most opportune time
to perform acts of mercy, since that time may never come. Advocates "the
little way" to do what one can, and not give in to the immensity of the
problems. Quotes Pius XII on works of mercy, that it is through charity
and not so much preaching that one gain souls. (DDLW \#64).*
