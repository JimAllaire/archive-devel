<dc:description>Condemns those Catholics who need to "keep up with the Joneses." Encourages her readers not to wait for the most opportune time to perform acts of mercy, since that time may never come. Advocates "the little way" to do what one can, and not give in to the immensity of the problems. Quotes Pius XII on works of mercy, that it is through charity and not so much preaching that one gain souls.</dc:description>
