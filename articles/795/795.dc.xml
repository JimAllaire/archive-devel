<dc:description>Comments on the campaign to make everyone literate in Cuba and the impassioned style of Fidel Castro's oratory. Asserts that she found freedom of religion. Includes an extensive quote from Castro where he says one can be a revolutionist and a Catholic as long as anyone holds to the aims of the revolution and justice holding religious beliefs in his heart.</dc:description>
