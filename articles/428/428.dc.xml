<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Surveys the rural area around the Easton, PA, farm from "a distributist point of view" visiting a bookbinder's shop and complaining about polluting factories. Laments that the Catholic Worker hasn't produced more craftsmen. Enumerates all the work projects underway and the schedule of retreats. Joyfully announces the birth of her second grandchild, Susanna.</dc:description>
