<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Notes the poor women hired as &quot;walking billboards&quot; whose miserable appearance belies the glamour of the products which they advertise. Compares the physical abuse of Catholic Worker pamphleteers to that suffered by Jesus during His Passion. Observes that such treatment deepens our appreciation of Christ's suffering. Summarizes Father Lord's lecture on the differences between Nationalism and Patriotism.</dc:description>
