Chastity
========

**By Dorothy Day**

Ave Maria, (December 10, 1966):19-21.

*Summary: Explains the differences between sex inside and outside
marriage. Describes it as the closest thing to beatific vision,
something as holy that must be placed in the context of holiness.
Contrast this with the growing obsession with sex that places it in the
realm of the secular. (DDLW \#129).*
