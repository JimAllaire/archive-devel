<p><em>Summary: Explains the differences between sex inside and outside marriage. Describes it as the closest thing to beatific vision, something as holy that must be placed in the context of holiness. Contrast this with the growing obsession with sex that places it in the realm of the secular. (DDLW #129).</em></p>
