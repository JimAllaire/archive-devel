<dc:description>Describes the Catholic Worker as "an inn by the side of the road" and explains the attraction it has for people who want to do the works of mercy. Also talks about visitors, diminished interest in May Day rallies, groups for the mentally ill, and a delightful week of caring for her grandchildren.</dc:description>
