<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Distinguishes between the poor and the destitute, by giving particular stories of each. Tells of her encounter with the poor, who would work for the common good, who were happy, and who helped themselves, and the destitute, who were on the other hand helpless, without hope, and bitter.</dc:description>
