<p><em>Summary: Explains the lack of a full column due to the birth of her latest granddaughter. (DDLW #949).</em></p>
<p>Nothing can be more engrossing than taking care of children, and this month has been a busy one both on Staten Island, on the beach, and at Perkinsville, Vermont, where a new child, Catherine Ann, was born to David and Tamar Hennessy on July 9, instead of on July 24 when she was expected. Not only did I not write a continuation of my travels which I promised for this issue, but I wrote no &quot;on pilgrimage&quot; at all. Instead, I wrote a review of the one play I saw, &quot;The Connection&quot; and an account of the one Friday evening meeting I attended at which Fritz Eichenberg spoke. In the September issue, the &quot;On Pilgrimage&quot; will be continued.</p>
