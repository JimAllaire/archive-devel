<dc:description>Gives a brief history of the C.W., highlighting its beginnings, why its circulation declined in the thirties and how it keeps going with practically no money. Depicts P. Maurin's submissiveness and his desire for synthesis of cult, culture, and cultivation and the need for spiritual weapons to reorder society (Mass, sacrifice, voluntary poverty, and prayer).</dc:description>
