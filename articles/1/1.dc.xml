<dc:description>Autobiographical novel of her preconversion years. Begins with
family relationships, with emphasis on her mother. Proceeds through
her radical years with the pacifist, birth control, socialist
and suffrage movements, and ends with her abortion and break up
with Lionel Moise (Dick Wemys). William Miller's biography on
D. Day gives the real names of the characters. New York Times
reviewed the book as just one more adolescent novel,&quot; and
D. Day latter called it a bad book.</dc:description>
