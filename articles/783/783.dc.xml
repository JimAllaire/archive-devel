<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Recounts with gratitude the donations they receive and notes how quickly they become poor again. Upbraids herself for giving advice instead of giving leeway to each worker. Doesn't like all the clutter but respects individual freedom. Travels to Detroit, then to visit Tamar in Vermont.</dc:description>
