<dc:description>Argues that distributism is the only alternative to the US economy. Distributism is an alternative to capitalism and socialism built around "the village economy" and a more just distribution of wealth. Quotes four modern Popes in its support. Summarizes its principles with the following Statements:

"land is the most natural form of property"

"wages should enable man to purchase land"

"the family is the most perfect when rooted in its own holdings"

"agriculture is the first and most important of all arts." (See also DOC #159 and DOC #161)</dc:description>
