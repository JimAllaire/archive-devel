<dc:description>States St. Therese, the Little Flower, is not a "sentimental" saint but one to "dread" once one gets to know her. Responding to critics, itemizes the cost of Peter Maurin's funeral. Says "We should prepare for death with joy, as for our nuptials." Notes they heard talks on three great Russians: Dostoevsky, Tolstoi, and Soloviev.
