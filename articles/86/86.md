===============================

**By Dorothy Day**

Third Hour, 5 (1951) :55-59.

*Summary: Focuses on P. Maurin's idea of farm communes. Proposes to have
scholars become workers and workers become scholars, and to have them
recognize the Sacramental aspect of work. Describes the difficulties of
varying personalities and the successes of pooling sources together from
the community. (DDLW \#86).*
