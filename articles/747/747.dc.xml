<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Culling newspaper accounts of the newly elected Pope, John XXIII, she describes him as a man who loves the soil and family. Includes quotes from his first public address on love of the poor and condemnation of preparing for war. Explains what it means to struggle for justice and to do so "even if by force," a phrase the Pope used.</dc:description>
