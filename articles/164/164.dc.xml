<dc:description>Complains of the lack of help from the Church to promote unions. Forcefully explains the difference between communism and the C.W. and contends that the greatest threat to the Church is the working man's ignorance of the Church's social teaching not communism, which is "simply a consequence to the ignorance."</dc:description>
