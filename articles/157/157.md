% Letter on Hospices
% Dorothy Day

*The Catholic Worker*, January 1948, 2,8.

*Summary: Discourages Hospices from adopting committee rule and prefers
one person to take leadership. Personal responsibility is "being what
you want the other fellow to be." Informs of the monotony of Hospice
work, but such is "the little way." (DDLW \#157).*
