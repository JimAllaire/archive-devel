<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>


<I>The Catholic Worker</I>, January 1948, 2,8.

</p>

<P><I>Summary: 
 Discourages Hospices from adopting committee rule and prefers one person to take leadership. Personal responsibility is "being what you want the other fellow to be." Informs of the monotony of Hospice work, but such is "the little way." (DDLW #157). </I></p>
