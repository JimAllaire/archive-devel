<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Admits "rambling" about her grandchildren, her reading habits, and books she recommends before getting to the point--"I am afraid I am a traditionalist." She reaffirms her high regard for the liturgical movement and the Mass, objecting to an incident where a coffee cup is used for a chalice. She speaks of CW conflicts and the ongoing struggle of freedom and authority.</dc:description>
