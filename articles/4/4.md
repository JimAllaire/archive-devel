*Summary: A novel which relates the difficult childhood of Monica, who
grows up with both committed Catholics and Communists. Monica, whose
ideas and experiences resemble those of the author, finds herself torn
between Nick and her Christian faith. At the end of her spiritual
struggle she lets go of Nick and grasps her faith. Throughout the book
the C.W. philosophy is articulated through Monica and Peter the
Agitator, who reflects the thought of Peter Maurin. (DDLW \#4).*
