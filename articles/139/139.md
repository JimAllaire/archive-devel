Fellowship, 4 (March 1975):7-9

*Summary: Acceptance speech for the Gandhi Award. Compares the
depression of the '70s and '30s and believes the '70s was worse due to
government regulations which hindered people from helping themselves.
However in happy to see the youth getting back to the land and the peace
movement growing. (DDLW \#139).*
