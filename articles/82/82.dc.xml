<dc:description>Traces traditions started by clerics, which would isolate a place or time period as sacred, where war would be absent. Complains, however, that at present, clerics are either involved directly in the war or supporting it from the pulpit. Encourages them to become more in line with their religious rather than their political tradition.</dc:description>
