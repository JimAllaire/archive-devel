<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Travels by train to the Grail in Ohio, then to the Midwest praising a variety of works of mercy on the land. "A pilgrimage indeed, and a most encouraging one, visiting readers of the paper, families and cells which are growing up everywhere, grappling all of them with the spiritual weapons of hard work, poverty, and prayer."</dc:description>
