<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>


<I>The Catholic Worker</I>, July-August 1964, 1, 6, 8.

</p>

<P><I>Summary: 
 Elaborates on the Catholic Worker relationship with Church authorities over many years and the "conflict of freedom and authority." Reaffirms the laity's freedom of conscience and leadership role in action against injustice. Reproaches "our shepherds" who fail to preach voluntary poverty and "preach the gospel in season, out of season, and that gospel is 'all men are brothers.'" (DDLW #196). </I></p>
<P><P>Of all hostilities one of the saddest is the war between clergy and
laity. We have written and spoken many times of all the aspects of
war, the beginnings in our own hearts, the hostilities in the family
between husband and wife, parents and children, children and parents. 
The entire conflict of authority and freedom. <STRONG>The Catholic
Worker</STRONG>, pacifist and anarchist in philosophy, has had to
discuss and write about all these things, in particular, and in
general.<P>

<P>The works of mercy are works of love. The works of war are works
of the devil,--"You do not know of what spirit you are," Jesus said to
his disciples when they would call down fire from heaven on the
inhospitable Samaritans. This is to look at things in the large
context of modern war. But as for the hostilities in our midst, the
note of violence and conflict in all our dealings with
others,--everyone seems to contribute to it. There is no room for
righteous wrath today. In the entire struggle over civil rights, the
war which is going on in which one side is nonviolent, suffering
martyrdoms, every movement of wrath in the heart over petty
hostilities must be struggled with in order to hold up the strength of
the participants.<P>

<P>"Let us but raise the level of religion in our hearts, and it will
rise in the world," Newman wrote. "He who attempts to set up God's
kingdom in his heart, furthers it in the world." We cannot all go on
Freedom Rides, or take part in the COFO program in Mississippi, as
young students are doing. (Marie Asche, who worked with us last
summer, has gone to Mississippi.) But we can sustain them in our
contributions, money, prayers, and by works in our local area along
these lines.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Seminarians</STRONG></CENTER><P>

This is what seminarians and the Catholic Interracial group have been
doing in Los Angeles, not only this year but for many years, only to
meet with prohibitions of meetings, to setting up interracial
councils, and so on. This silence and non-cooperation on the part of
the priest and bishop and cardinal, this more than silence,--this
censure, this prohibition, has increased the separation of clergy and
laity, and has built up a wall of bitterness.<P>

<P>Last month a young priest in the Los Angeles diocese wrote a letter
to the Holy Father, asking for the removal of Cardinal McIntyre from
the work of the diocese. His letter was given to the press all over
the country and was reprinted by both secular and Catholic press.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Caine Mutiny</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>When I read the accounts in the dailies and some of the diocesan
press, I thought of <STRONG>The Caine Mutiny</STRONG>. When I read
the book, I compared it with the stories of the sea in Joseph Conrad's
novels. The reasonable interference of the sturdy mate in the more
recent book brought him to trial on the charge of mutiny. One of the
things that struck me most forcibly in the latter book was the
difference between the worker mate and the intellectual officer who
needled him into making complaints and then would not back him up, who
urged him to save the ship and the crew by disobeying orders, and then
would not testify for him at the trial.<P>

<P>When a friend was criticizing one of the Cardinals as being
backward and restrictive of the freedom of the laity at that time, I
was reminded of the book I had just read and I asked him why he did
not go to the Chancery office and state his complaints, his
remonstrances. The laity have a freedom to express themselves that
the clergy do not. The late beloved Fr. LaFarge, S.J. said in one of
his last books, that the trouble with the church in America was a
bullying clergy and a subservient laity and when I quoted that
statement in regard to an incident which happened at the CW house of
hospitality in Chicago, one of our readers wrote in angrily holding us
to be the author of the statement of Fr. LaFarge.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Cardinals</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>I had not intended to write at length about this Los Angeles
incident since so many of the diocesan papers and weeklies gave it
ample coverage. But I recalled letters I had received in the last
year, asking my advice as to what to do, letters from the laity and
from the seminarians, east and west,--and when I recalled too my long
acquaintance with Cardinal McIntyre, (shall I say friendship?) I
decided I would write at length, and personally. What I say about
him, I could say also in one way or another about Cardinal Spellman
and Cardinal Cushing.<P>

<P>Another reason why it is good to write at length is that the
problem has to do with war, with race, with poverty, voluntary and
involuntary, with spiritual teaching, and our dissatisfaction with it.
 And what we can do about all these things.<P>

<P>One of the newspapers in New York talked about the indignity which
the young priest was forced to submit to, the kneeling before his
superior and promising obedience. I do not know what the ceremony
was, but I imagine it is that one that occurs at every ordination,
when the candidate for the priesthood kneels and placing his two hands
within the hands of the bishop, swears obedience. One never hears a
Catholic objecting to this. We lay people kneel to receive
absolution, to receive a blessing, to receive all the sacraments, as
coming from God, through the priest. The non-Catholic does not
realize what a relationship of love and loyalty there is between the
layman and the priest, the priest and bishop. In all the great events
of one's life, birth, marriage and death, and for the unmarried the
confirming of their vocation. For the times of sin and sickness,
there is absolution and anointing, and at the moment of death, the
holy oils and the prayers of priest and the people. It is our Faith
which lends strength and dignity to our paltry and tragic lives. "In
Thy hand are strength and power and to Thy hand it belongs to make
everything great and strong."<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>An Early Friend</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>I first met Cardinal McIntyre back in the late twenties when I was
filled with the longing to be a Catholic and could not because of
marriage difficulties. One goes to a priest in the chancery office to
straighten out these difficulties and Cardinal McIntyre who was then a
monsignor was the one assigned to me to take care of my inquiries. 
His office was not a private one. His was one of a long row of desks
on either side of the room, far enough apart so that one could talk
privately. There was always a long line of people waiting in the
outer office, and one by one, we were ushered in. There was never any
haste about these interviews. He always gave me most courteous and
sympathetic attention and I remember times when I was there at noon
and he had a sandwich and a glass of milk brought to his desk. He
said the Angelus when the clock struck twelve. I remember thinking
how hard these young priests had to work, the tales they had to listen
to. They had to be lawyers, psychologists, priests, all in one. 
Between him and Father Hyland, another young priest at Tottenville,
Staten Island, I was helped along the way, over a period of several
years, and was baptized.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Priests and The Worker</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>When five years later I started <STRONG>The Catholic
Worker</STRONG> at the instigation of Peter Maurin, I did not ask
permission,--I did not discuss it with the chancery office. My
contact with these young priests made me realize the more what I had
always felt,--that Catholics lived in a world of their own, quite
apart from the rest of the population. They did represent the Irish,
the Italians, the Poles, the Hungarians and all the rest of the
immigrant Catholic crowd who seemed so apart in every way, not just by
religion, from the rest of the white, Protestant and generally middle
class people from whom I sprang. I felt the order, the discipline of
their lives, even if it meant a twenty minute Mass on a week day. In
complete silence, and a three quarters of an hour of worship on Sunday
with news of bingo parties and coal collections scattered in with
announcements of requiem Masses and banns of marriage.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>No Permission Asked</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>I had been writing articles for the <STRONG>Sign</STRONG>, for
<STRONG>America</STRONG>, the Jesuit paper, and doing clerical work
for Fr. Joseph McSorley the Paulist and when I spoke to them of my
venture, all three editors, Father Harold Purcell, Fr. Parsons, and
Fr. McSorley all advised me to launch out, but not to ask permission. 
But I understood why. How make the hierarchy responsible for such an
unproved venture? They might be held responsible for debts to be
contracted--perhaps that was also understood to be part of the
question.<P>

<P>At any rate the first issues of the paper came out and were greeted
with enthusiasm by clergy and laity alike. The circulation soared,
enough contributions came in so that hospitality could be provided for
the down and outs that made up our first staff.<P>

Workers and scholars alike were down and out in the depression, and we
have always been the lame, the halt and the blind, the off scouring of
all, to use St. Paul's phrase, all through the years. "The gold is
ejected and the dross remains," one of our friends said of us. We
were greeted by those who did not know us as a pack of saints, and the
legend continued to grow, such a term giving an easy way out to those
who felt themselves to be happily more publicans than pharisees. Our
standards were too high, could not possibly be lived up to, but it was
good to be reminded of them. Such principles would not work, they
showed pride and presumption in a way, but they evidenced the longing
in every human heart for the lost Eden of the past and the Paradise we
all hoped for in the future. We were Utopians, in other words.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Full Freedom</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>Well, we have hung on to our personalist communitarian philosophy
over the years, and it has been called anarchism, pacifism,
communitarian socialism and many other things. But through all the
years, there was never any criticism from the chancery office in New
York, New Jersey, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Omaha
-- wherever there were demonstrations about race or war.<P>

The Baltimore House of Hospitality was closed as a public nuisance. 
It was inter-racial when it was against the law to have both black and
white under the same roof in a hostel. Civil Disobedience began for
us then.<P>

<P>Irene Mary Naughton was arrested for picketing in an inter-racial
demonstration at Palisades Amusement Park. This was in the forties
and was just the beginning of CW involvement. But still the chancery
offices never interfered. They never committed themselves either.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal History</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>We were too busy to worry much about the attitudes of individual
priests in chancery offices or parishes. Somehow or other, I had
always realized that the church was made up of every political
viewpoint as well as of saints and sinners, that there was room for
all, that people were the product of their environment. Then too I
had my own family to remind me, a conservative one in many ways. My
own father was most intemperate in his remarks not only about the
"foreigner" but about the Negro, coming from Tennessee as he did, and
there were my Georgia cracker cousins, hard shelled Baptists,
fundamentalists, Campbellites, religious bigots and racists
undoubtedly. And yet one could not <STRONG>hate </STRONG>them. They
could not prevent one from going one's own way. So it was the same
with the Church, the family of the Church, Churchmen became
conservative; had to hang on to the gains made in a country which
spoke of Hunkies, Dagoes, Spiks, Micks, greasers and so on. These
despised ones showed that they could make it too.<P>

<P>But the people didn't get much more "instruction" than the Asians
St. Francis Xavier reached with the teaching of prayers, and the
pouring on of water in baptism. Get to Sunday Mass, make your Easter
duty, don't marry outside the faith,--the grace of the sacraments
would do all the rest.<P>

<P>This was my first impression of the church until Peter Maurin
opened my eyes to the splendid literature of the church, the social
teaching, and I travelled and found like-minded people all over the
country. From the first we had the advice and instruction of good and
holy, and learned priests,--all of which gave us courage.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Routine Complaints</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>We were called to the chancery office occasionally. At first I saw
only Monsignor McIntyre, and later it was Monsignor Gaffney. It was
always over some trivial matter. After a few years, I felt that I
understood the technique. I would get a letter reading, "Dear
Dorothy, if you happen to be in the neighborhood, would you please
drop in." I very seldom was in the neighborhood of Fiftieth
street,--all our work being on the east side, but I took care to go at
once. Monsignor McIntyre would greet me in most friendly fashion and
then press a button for a stenographer. She would bring in a file,
and he would open to a letter, one of a long pile of letters, and
holding his hand over the signature, he would say, "We have received a
complaint about something in the last issue of the CW," and he would
read out some line like "Would you have your daughter go to the
marriage bed with a Negro?" (I remember that line well. This was
from a satirical article by Robert Ludlow.) Quite often the
sentiments objected to were from his writings.<P>

<P>There was never any comment. But a few friendly inquiries about
the work. I do not recall how many times I had these meetings with
Monsignor McIntyre.<P>

<P>I remember once asking him for the use of an unoccupied rectory on
the east side. Insurance problems, probable trouble with the board of
health and the fire department and building department stood in the
way, however.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Backing a Loan</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>But he tried to help us. Before we got our Peter Maurin Farm on
Staten Island, I found a place on the beach down near Tottenville that
I wanted very much to buy and Bishop McIntyre, sympathizing with our
money problems, offered to back or sponsor a bank loan for us for
fifteen thousand dollars but that deal fell through because of the
usual housing, health and fire department restrictions, on our
work.<P>

<P>No comment was ever made by the by-then bishop or archbishop about
political views. When we started to run articles like "War and
Conscription at the Bar of Christian Morals," by Monsignor Barry
O'Toole of the Catholic University and "The Crime of Conscription" and
"Catholics Can Be Conscientious Objectors," by Fr. John Jr. Hugo of
Pittsburgh, Bishop McIntyre merely commented, during one of these
aforesaid visits, "We never studied these things much in the
seminary." Shaking his head, and adding doubtfully, "There is the
necessity of course to inform one's conscience." And I assured him
that that was what we were trying to do.<P>

<P>A recent paper back called <STRONG>The Essential Newman</STRONG>
carries part of Cardinal Newman's correspondence with Gladstone in
which he discusses <STRONG>conscience</STRONG>, and he is reported to
have said that if he were called upon to propose a toast on such a
subject, which was unlikely, he would propose--"to conscience first,
and to the Pope second." This was at a time when there was great
discussion of new dogma, infallibility of the Pope.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Laymen lead</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>Bishop O'Hara of Kansas City once said to Peter Maurin, "You lead
the way,--we will follow." Meaning that it was up to the laity to
plough ahead, to be the vanguard, to be the shock troops, to fight
these battles without fear or favor. And to make the mistakes. And
that has always been my understanding. This business of "asking
Father" what to do about something has never occurred to us. The way
I have felt about Los Angeles is that the lay people had to go ahead
and form their groups, "Catholics for interracial justice," form their
picket lines, as they are only now doing, and make their complaints
directly, to priest and cardinal, demanding the leadership, the moral
example they are entitled to.<P>

How can any priest be prevented from preaching the gospel of social
justice in the labor field and in the inter-racial field? One can
read aloud with loud agreement those messages from the encyclicals,
which are so pertinent to the struggles which are being carried on. 
One can tell the gospel stories in the light of what is happening
today. Do the poor have the gospel preached to them today? Do we
hear that resounding cry, "Woe to the rich!" Do we hear the story of
the rich man sitting at his table feasting while the poor sat at the
gate with neither food nor medicare? How many priests have read Fr.
Regamey's <STRONG>Poverty </STRONG>or Shewring's <STRONG>The Rich and
the Poor in Christian Tradition</STRONG>?<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Poverty Frees</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>It is voluntary poverty which needs to be preached to the
comfortable congregations, so that a man will not be afraid of losing
his job if he speaks out on these issues. So that pastors or
congregations will not be afraid of losing the support of rich
benefactors. A readiness for poverty, a disposition to accept it, is
enough to begin with. We will always get what we need. "Take no
thought for what you shall eat or drink,--the Lord knows you have need
of these things."<P>

<P>If more seminarians spoke out, even if the seminaries were emptied!
(It is said the seminaries of France were half emptied because of the
Algerian War, which went on for so long). If more young priests spoke
out while they continued to work hard and continued to "be what they
wished the other fellow to be," as Peter Maurin put it,--what happy
results might not be brought about.<P>

<P>But often the critical spirit results in dissertations, from church
and priesthood and seminary, and I suppose that is what the hierarchy
fears. We have plenty of experience of the critical spirit and have
seen the ravages that can be wrought in family and community. We have
had many a good worker leave because he could not stand the
frustrations, because "those in charge" did not throw out trouble
makers, or force people to do better. The critical spirit can be the
complaining spirit too, and the murmurer and complainer does more harm
than good.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Freedom With Charity</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>If we could strive for the spirit of a St. Francis, and it would be
good to read his life and struggles, we would be taking a first step,
but it is only God himself who can make a saint, can send the grace
necessary to enable him to suffer the consequences of following his
conscience and to do it in such a way as not to seem to be passing
judgment on another, but rather win him to another point of view, with
love and with respect.<P>

<P><STRONG>"You have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, Resist not evil: but if one
strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; and if a
man will contend with thee in judgment and take away thy coat, let go
thy cloak also unto him, and whosoever will force thee to go one mile,
go with him another two. Give to him that asketh of thee, and of him
that would borrow of thee turn not away. You have heard that it hath
been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy. But I say
to you, love your enemies, do good to them that hate you; and pray for
them that persecute and calumniate you, that you may be children of
your father who is in heaven who makes his sun to rise upon the good
and the bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust. For if you
love them that love you, what reward shall you have? Do not even the
publicans this? And if you salute your brethren only, what do you
more? do not also the heathen this? Be you therefore perfect as your
heavenly Father is perfect."</STRONG><P>

Hard sayings indeed and no wonder that St. Peter said, in another
context, when Jesus said that it was harder for a camel to go through
the eye of the needle than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of
heaven, "Who then can be saved?" "With God all things are
possible."<P>

<P>When a man, black or white, reaches the point where he recognizes
the worth of his soul (what does it profit a man if he gain the whole
world and suffer the loss of his soul?)--when he begins to realize
what it means to be a child of God, a son, an heir also, the sense of
his own dignity as a child of God is so great that no indignity can
touch him, or discourage him from working for the common good.<P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>A Greater Task</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<P>It is for this that our shepherds are to be reproached, that they
have not fed their sheep these strong meats, this doctrine of men
divinized by the sacraments, capable of overcoming all obstacles in
their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good.<P>

<P>Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their
own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop
them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way.<P>

<P>But one must always follow one's conscience, preach the gospel in
season, out of season, and that gospel is "all men are brothers."<P>

<P>This teaching is contained in all the work of the Confraternities
of Christian Doctrine. It just needs to be applied. </p>
