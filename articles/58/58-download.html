<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>


Preservation of the Faith, (December 1935):12-13.

</p>

<P><I>Summary: 
 Distinguishes two types of Communism, one voluntarily chosen, a Christian Communism, and the other a dictatorship Communism. Although rejecting an imposed Communism, she also rejects capitalism. Upholding voluntary poverty does mean affirming destitution, and above all does not mean a passive acceptance of oppressive systems. (DDLW #58). </I></p>
