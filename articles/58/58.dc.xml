<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Distinguishes two types of Communism, one voluntarily chosen, a Christian Communism, and the other a dictatorship Communism. Although rejecting an imposed Communism, she also rejects capitalism. Upholding voluntary poverty does mean affirming destitution, and above all does not mean a passive acceptance of oppressive systems.</dc:description>
