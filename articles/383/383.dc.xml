<dc:description>Inspired by the beauty and inner-city location of Los Angeles' St. Bibiana Cathedral, this editorial focuses on the poor--" The closer we are to the poor, the closer to Christ's love." Because May, 1942 marked <I>The Catholic Worker</I>'s tenth year, reminds readers that we are called to love all men, friend and foe alike, because all are brothers--"love is shown by works of mercy, not by war."</dc:description>
