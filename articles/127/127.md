% Dorothy Day

Ave Maria, (December 3, 1966):21,22,29.

*Summary: Explains the misconceptions of those who see voluntary poverty
as destitution and the absence of beauty and order. Discusses the
different places where poverty exists and urges a personal response as
the solution, rather than a state solution. Uses scripture as the basis
for her personalist argument. (DDLW \#127).*
