<h1 id="the-meaning-of-poverty">The Meaning of Poverty</h1>
<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>Ave Maria, (December 3, 1966):21,22,29.</p>
<p><em>Summary: Explains the misconceptions of those who see voluntary poverty as destitution and the absence of beauty and order. Discusses the different places where poverty exists and urges a personal response as the solution, rather than a state solution. Uses scripture as the basis for her personalist argument. (DDLW #127).</em></p>
