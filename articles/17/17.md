The Scandal of the Works of Mercy
=================================

**By Dorothy Day**

Commonweal, 51 (November 4, 1949): 99-102.

*Summary: Distinguishes between spiritual and corporal works of mercy,
and argues the need to perform them, and not to relinquish such works to
the state. Advocates a personalism and distributism as alternatives to
capitalism and communism. Also describes the C.W.'s street apostolate
and farm retreat houses (DDLW \#17).*
