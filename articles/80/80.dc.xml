<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A fragment from her unpublished work on P. Maurin. Explains his idea of a valiant woman as read in Proverbs 31, "Woman is matter and man is spirit." Defends Peter's understanding of women; clarifies that "woman is matter" in the sense that they are "close to the sources of life", the nourisher, the Mother Earth. Discusses the women who come to the C.W. and observes how they fall far from Peter's idea.</dc:description>
