Commonweal, 45 (December 6, 1946):188-191.

*Summary: A fragment from her unpublished work on P. Maurin. Explains
his idea of a valiant woman as read in Proverbs 31, "Woman is matter and
man is spirit." Defends Peter's understanding of women; clarifies that
"woman is matter" in the sense that they are "close to the sources of
life", the nourisher, the Mother Earth. Discusses the women who come to
the C.W. and observes how they fall far from Peter's idea. (DDLW \#80).*
