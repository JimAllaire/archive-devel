Explains his idea of a valiant woman as read in Proverbs 31, &quot;Woman is matter and man is spirit.&quot; Defends Peter's understanding of women; clarifies that &quot;woman is matter&quot; in the sense that they are &quot;close to the sources of life&quot;, the nourisher, the Mother Earth. Discusses the women who come to the C.W. and observes how they fall far from Peter's idea. (DDLW #80).</em></p>
