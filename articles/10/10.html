<p><strong>By Dorothy Day</strong></p>
<p>San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1963</p>
<p><em>Summary: Reprinted in 1972 by Curtis Books and in 1983 by Harper (Robert Coles introduction). Makes the distinction between poverty as a sociological phenomenon and a spiritual opportunity, and advocates the latter and condemns the former. Much of the material concerns the wide variety of people and ideas at the C.W. from 1933 to the early 60s. Her three main characters are Peter Maurin, Ammon Hennancy, and Fr. Pacifigue Roy. Describes the gross injustice that she encountered and speaks of the high regard she had for priests and the editors and workers she meet at the C.W. (DDLW #10).</em></p>
