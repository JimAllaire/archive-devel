<dc:description>Reprinted in 1972 by Curtis Books and in 1983 by Harper (Robert
Coles introduction).

Makes the distinction between poverty as a sociological phenomenon
and a spiritual opportunity, and advocates the latter and condemns
the former. Much of the material concerns the wide variety of
people and ideas at the C.W. from 1933 to the early 60s. Her three
main characters are Peter Maurin, Ammon Hennancy, and Fr. Pacifigue
Roy. Describes the gross injustice that she encountered and speaks
of the high regard she had for priests and the editors and workers
she meet at the C.W.</dc:description>
