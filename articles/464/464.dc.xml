<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Writing from her daughter's farm in West Viriginia, comments on the cold and kid's play. Reports on her travels through the Southwest, Seattle, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Minnesota extolling the need for supporting the family and a return to the land. Distinguishes types of anarchism and the need for study. Wants more priests to have a vision of a new social order.</dc:description>
