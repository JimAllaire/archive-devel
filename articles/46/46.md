St. John of the Cross
=====================

**By Dorothy Day**

Commonweal, 18 (July 19, 1933):287-288.

*Summary: Discusses the riches of poverty and the joy one receives from
its vow. Much of the article, however, is about St. Teresa of Avila,
rather than St. John. Describes the gaiety which emanated from their
lives, in view of their suffering. (DDLW \#46).*
