<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Describes the bucolic scene at Peter Maurin Farm as she begins to write her column. Relishes their joy and reminds us of the sorrowful aspects of life, for example, drunkenness. Talks of how hard it is to serve the poor and keep at the mundane drudgery--"the mystery of sin and suffering."</dc:description>
