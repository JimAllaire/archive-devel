<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Describes efforts aimed at alleviating injustice in the name of Christ, and encourages particularly the laity to be instruments of God. Lay people as well as clerics are called to be saints. Commends those groups, most notably the Worker Priests, The Order of Builders, and the C.W., for bringing Christ to the poor.</dc:description>
