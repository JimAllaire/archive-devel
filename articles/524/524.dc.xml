<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While appealing for help, she extols the constant stream of young volunteers who come to the CW, "as to a school," preparing them for careers in line with the works of mercy. Notes their folly and reliance on the "little way" of St. Therese.</dc:description>
