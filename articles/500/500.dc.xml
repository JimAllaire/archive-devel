<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Appeals for help and answers the question "What is it all about, this Catholic Worker movement?" Describes the Catholic Worker as a school, a family, and a community of need. Says they are anarchist-pacifist, which is distinguished from nihilism. Asserts the primacy of conscience and "The most effective action we can take is to try to conform our lives to the folly of the Cross, as St. Paul called it." Keywords: Catholic Worker philosophy, non-violence </dc:description>
