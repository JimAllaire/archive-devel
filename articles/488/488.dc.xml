<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Attends the trial of Catholic Worker Bob Ludlow who was arrested for picketing with others outside a school. Notes how the judge handles numerous cases of public drunkenness and vagrancy related to homelessness. The judge dismisses the picketers after voicing his opposition to their views. She thinks of Thomas Moore's trial and martyrdom.</dc:description>
