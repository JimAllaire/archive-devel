<dc:description>1948 is the date of her most complete draft. Others include in
her papers date from ca. 1943 to 1950.

A fragmented biography, filled with digressions, which describes
Maurin as &quot;a genius, a saint, an agitator, a writer, a lecturer,
a poor man, and a shabby tramp, all rolled into one.&quot; The
publisher rejected the manuscript on the grounds that D. Day was
too close to the subject and could not evaluate it from an objective
view. A brief summary of this work can be found in Miller's biography,
chapter 9 &quot;The Gentle Personalist&quot;. Exposes the four
main emphases of Maurin's thought, Papal encyclicals, personalism,
the saints, and poverty. Describes how his ideas of Houses of
Hospitality, Farm Communes, and round table discussions became
the realities of the C.W.</dc:description>
