<dc:description>Finds it hard to write about her sister Della who died--"my closest friend and confidante." Recalls growing up in Chicago together and their reading, conversations, and walks. Notes their differences over birth control--Della had worked for Margaret Sanger who Dorothy once interviewed.</dc:description>
