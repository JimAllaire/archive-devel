<dc:description>A novel which relates the difficult childhood of Monica, who
grows up with both committed Catholics and Communists. Monica,
whose ideas and experiences resemble those of the author, finds
herself torn between Nick and her Christian faith. At the end
of her spiritual struggle she lets go of Nick and grasps her faith.
Throughout the book the C.W. philosophy is articulated through
Monica and Peter the Agitator, who reflects the thought of Peter
Maurin.</dc:description>
