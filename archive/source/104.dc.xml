<dc:source>Liberation, 2 (September 1957):5-7.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Discusses the difficulty of adjusting to society after jail and how children who receive no parental guidance often are the ones caught up in deviant behavior. Criticizes those women who work in order to purchase luxuries and in the process neglect their children. Encourages "the little way" to liberation and the need for civil disobedience.</dc:description>
