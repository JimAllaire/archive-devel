<dc:description>A biography of St. Therese of Lisieux, whose life exemplifies
that of &quot;the little way&quot;. She is described as one who
knew the problems of daily living and saw that sanctity was not
limited to great miracles and martyrdom but lay also in living
God's Word in the routine affairs of daily life. Places Therese
largely in the context of her family and discusses the interaction
and effects her family had on her. A smaller portion is given
to her life in the convent. The author also discusses the working
class struggle in France and how Therese's family reacted to it.
Dorothy appeared to have some misgivings about the book when she
wrote, &quot;I am a diarist, a journalist not a biographer.</dc:description>
