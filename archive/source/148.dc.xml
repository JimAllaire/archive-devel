<dc:creator>Dorothy Day</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Discusses the two major subjects of her speaking engagements, Peter Maurin, whom she describes as founder and mind of the C.W., and personalism, which she describes as communitarian, and the philosophy of both P. Maurin and the C.W.. Describes some of the difficulties in living the CW vocation and running farming communes. Recommends reading the Desert Fathers and Aldous Huxley's <i> Grey Eminence</i> to understand personalism and communitarianism.</dc:description>
